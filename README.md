# User Management Frontend

## Description

This project is a frontend application developed using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to interact with a backend API for user management, authentication, and more. It provides functionality for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting user profiles.

## üì¶ Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- [JWT (JSON Web Tokens)](https://jwt.io/) - For user authentication and authorization.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - For routing and navigation within the app.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional) - For containerized development environment.

## üöÄ Features

- Administrator login.
- View, create, update, and delete users.
- Admin dashboard for managing users.
- JWT authentication and session management.
- Full frontend-backend interaction via REST API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

VITE_API_URL= Your Backend URL
```

Make sure to set the correct API URL for your backend.

### 3. Start with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## üß± Future Enhancements

1. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
   In the future, we can add roles to the users (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator) and manage access rights based on these roles. This would involve extending the backend API to handle roles for each user, ensuring that only authorized users have access to certain routes or functionalities.

2. **User Permissions Management**:  
   Along with roles, consider implementing user permissions to fine-tune which actions a user can perform (e.g., view only, create, update, delete). This would be helpful to create a more robust system that controls access to different parts of the application.

3. **Session Management**:  
   Currently, the app relies on JWT tokens for authentication. Consider implementing features like token refresh or session expiration handling for better security and usability.

4. **UI Enhancements**:  
   Improve the design by adding more interactive features such as loading spinners, form validation indicators, and better error messages to enhance the user experience.

5. **Testing**:  
   Add unit and integration tests using libraries like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). This will ensure that the app is robust and maintains high quality through future updates.
